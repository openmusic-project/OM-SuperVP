## Description

The OM-SuperVP tools are organized in three main categories : **analysis**, **processing**, and **synthesis**.

OM-SuperVP provides :

- a user-friendly interface to the sound processing kernel in your favorite computer-aided composition environment ;
- formatting sound processing or analysis parameters for SuperVP using OM symbolic/musical objects and visual programming tools ;
- designing complex processes including it√©rative/sequencial calls to the sound processing kernel ;
- connecting SuperVP processes to compositional processes and models developed in OM ;
- ...

## Configuration

Once the OM-SuperVP library is loaded in OM, a new item will appear in the Externals tab of the OM Preferences window.

Depending on your distribution SuperVP might or might not be present in your library package. 
If needed you can specify the path to another location where it might be installed (e.g. within the _AudioSculpt_ application package).

#### Notes
- OM will display the kernel path in red if it is not found or not set correctly.
- With the AudioSculpt installation, the sound processing kernels can be found inthe _AudioSculpt x.x.x/Kernels/_ folder.
